# Machine-learning-project-using-Python

Created a comprehensive report and developed a number of machine learning models for tasks related to classification, regression, and unsupervised learning using three different datasets. Data cleaning, feature selection, and EDA were carried out in order to address research questions which was contrasted against existing literature. KMeans algorithm and PCA were used to identify homogeneous customer groups for a wholesaler. The best regression model was identified after five models were tested to forecast CO2 emissions from automobiles. The best model was identified after five different classification models were developed to categorise diabetic patients.
